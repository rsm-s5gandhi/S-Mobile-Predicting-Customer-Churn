# üì± S-Mobile: Predicting Customer Churn

This project explores the use of data science and predictive analytics to tackle customer churn for S-Mobile, a mobile telecommunications provider. The goal is to develop models that accurately identify customers at risk of churning, enabling more effective retention strategies and data-driven decision-making.

## üìå Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for mobile service providers, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. By leveraging historical customer data‚Äîincluding transactional records, service usage, and engagement patterns‚Äîthis project builds predictive models to flag at-risk customers before they leave.

Key objectives:
- Analyze customer data to uncover churn patterns
- Develop and compare machine learning models for churn prediction
- Provide actionable insights for targeted retention campaigns

## üîç Methodology

### Data Preparation
- **Data Sources:** Customer account histories, call/SMS/data records, billing info, and support tickets
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized features, encoded categorical variables
- **Feature Engineering:** Generated metrics for tenure, usage trends, payment patterns, service complaints, and prior retention offers

### Modeling Approach
- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- **Advanced Models:** Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

### Insights & Actions
- Identified key drivers of churn (e.g., high complaint rates, low usage, payment issues)
- Simulated targeted retention strategies for high-risk segments
